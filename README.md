# personal-project-4
personal project final submission

I used the Microsoft Python for Beginners course to assist me with my Fantasy Sports calculator. One of the first things I learned was using comments to help you label parts of your program as well as checking which parts of your program may or may not work. They were very effective at times and I would recommend everyone no matter your skill level to use them. When I kept receiving errors at times, I would turn certain lines into comments in order to help me find the problem. Also had a lot of help with conditions such as if and else statements. I had probably 40 to 50 if and else statements so getting a good and an above average understanding of these conditions was crucial. I learned a lot about how to solve errors as well as where they typically occur. This helped me with human use of the program because now I know where the most mistakes occur and I can try and get rid of them faster and more often. The next few things I learned didnâ€™t really needed to be used in my personal project, but I remember going over some of them in class and still had some questions on them. Before I remember importing some things during the exercises, we did during class but never really understood what it meant or did. After watching the videos, I know what it is and believe I could use them effectively and I different formats.
